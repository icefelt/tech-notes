### First Post

If you can read this, the site is on.

#### Here were some of my requirements and my choice located in parentheses

- easy to build on my mac (built on my mac)
- static site (Hugo)
- uses SSL certs and defaulitng to https (AWS Certificate Manager)
- hosted in the cloud in cheap storage, not a server (AWS S3)
- uses a CDN (AWS CloudFront)
- uses my domain, eissfeldt.com (AWS Route53)

#### I leaned heavily on these sites to build this.
